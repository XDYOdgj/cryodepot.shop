	var commentsList = [{"user":"str8moben","content":"I have always lauded Amazon for it's excellent customer service.However, Elenco in my opinion has far exceeded the service that Amazon has provided over the years.The snap circuits set is amazing, there are so many different, fun, educational, and exciting projects you can do with this set that it is still going strong after years of use.I originally started my kids off with the Green set, but took the leap to purchase this set after learning of the service that Elenco provides to their customers.My kids played with the Green set so much that they broke a few connections with some of the pieces.I contacted the company to find replacement parts thinking that i'd need to purchase them and the response I received blew me away.Even though the damage was not due to the company's flaw, merely normal wear and tear of my children, they told me all I needed to do was tell them the part(s) and my name/address.They literally sent me 3 replacement parts, no questions asked, no verification, nothing.I was absolutely so shocked that I went out immediately & purchased this set from Amazon.Just to support a company that is doing the right thing.I love the fact that they are focused on the customer.So back on this product...I love playing with this set with my kids, even I learn things with this set.I'm no electrician, but know enough to work on my electrical system at home and repair computers.The projects range from easy to challenging even for a grown man.They are educational and sufficiently different to provide hours of fun.We have over 20 hours of time into this set alone.I feel that this set is better than the Green set not just due to the depth of projects but due to the worksmanship of this product.It definitely seems like this has been honed in over the years, whereas the green set is a newer product.The manuals are great, they are very thorough and educational.The projects are a lot of fun and all are complete with the addition of a few common household items (like water), so everything needed is included in this set.I would like to purchase additional sets, like the Rover, but at this point have not finished all the projects in this set and the green set, so I feel like I need to get 100% out of these projects before we buy another set.I completely recommend this to any budding scientists, and advanced children that love to learn, and any adults that are looking for something fun and educational that they can enjoy with their children.","purchase_model":"Size: 750 Projects   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2014-05-11 17:50:16"},{"user":"Elizabeth Wagoner","content":"Excellent, safe, educational, fun! Bought for a seven year old and he loved it and built everything right away. This is very easy to use and figure out because it has good illustrations ( he didn\u2019t read the directions but he managed to assemble on his own by pictures only).","purchase_model":"Size: 300 Projects   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-19 17:50:16"},{"user":"Scott","content":"My 9-year old son and 7-year old daughter love this thing, heck, I love this thing!The after-school care that my kids go to has the less expensive model (the SC-300) and the kids were always playing with this, so when Christmas 2014 rolled around, I knew exactly what to get my kids.They\u2019ve had 7 months to play and build and imaginate (yup, that\u2019s a new word) with this kit and they\u2019ve absolutely loved it.I remember as a kid having a similar electronics kit that I spent much of my youth playing with, and I think I was just as excited to get this as my kids were.It\u2019s a little pricey, but after seeing how much all the kids at after-school care played with it\u2014and being able to view it in person\u2014I knew that it was worth it.The kit is very well laid out and there are plastic blow-molded trays that hold all the pieces together.This makes it very easy to tell if you\u2019re missing any pieces.There a 5 books of designs chock full of things for the kids to build and the instructions are very easy to understand and all the electronic components are clearly marked.One of the coolest things about this kit is it comes with hardware (a cable) that connects to your PC or laptop via the microphone port that turns your computer into an oscilloscope!It\u2019s basic stuff, but it works very well I and really takes this kit to a whole new level.It\u2019s really educational being able to show the kids voltages and currents and waveforms on the computer screen.It pulls together nicely the ability for the kids to physically see what\u2019s happening (motors turning, LEDs flashing), and see why it\u2019s happening (voltages/waveforms) on the oscilloscope.Now, you know you\u2019ve got something good when the kids start taking apart old toys (anything with a motor in it) and start adding on to this kit with pieces of wire (from the same cannibalized toy).Real MacGyver stuff going on here!The kids have even joined forces and connected their kit with friend\u2019s kits\u2014just make sure you have all your parts before the kids leave!I\u2019ve read some other reviews that are little hard on this kit and that it doesn\u2019t really teach kids about electronics\u2014that this kit it to \u201ccartoony\u201d and more of a puzzle than anything.Is this kit fun?You betcha.Is there learning and teaching happening?Absolutely.Are my kids going to learn about Maxwell\u2019s equation, Lorentz\u2019s law, Gauss\u2019 law?Probably not.I\u2019m an electrical engineer and I can see the fun and educational aspects that this kit provides.If your kids outgrow this and want something more advanced, than by all means get one of the more technical kits that are available.When you were teaching your kids to read, you didn\u2019t start with Tolstoy, did you?This is a fantabulous kit for kids and I\u2019m very happy I purchased it.It\u2019s well built, well thought out, and is definitely one of those toys that your children one day will blow the dust off the box and tell their children, \u201cLook at this toy I had when I was your age!?","purchase_model":"Size: 750 Projects   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2015-07-24 17:50:16"},{"user":"Britt","content":"","purchase_model":"Size: 100 Projects   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-04 17:50:16"},{"user":"C Timothy Moss","content":"We bought this as a Christmas gift for my eight-year-old grandson who is very inquisitive. This gift fit the Bill. He enjoyed it and played with it every day since he received it. We may have created a budding electrical engineer.","purchase_model":"Size: 100 Projects   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-30 17:50:16"}];
