	var commentsList = [{"user":"Bryanna","content":"We got a set of 16 at first and loved them so once my baby started crawling we bought the bigger pack to add to it! They hold their shape well as we\u2019ve had the first 16 for about 6 months already and have no issues. They\u2019re generally easy to clean though I do take them apart completely occasionally and wipe them down top to bottom, since they are on the floor and reasonably that takes some time. They\u2019re lightweight enough to move around easily, way lighter than a rug, but they somehow stay in place pretty well like a rug would so you don\u2019t have to worry about them sliding. I like that the colors aren\u2019t a color overload because it fits well in our living room without making it look like a daycare & also allows the toys themselves to stand out instead of the playmat. Over all very easy to put together and not a bad price by any means. We will be buying more to expand the safe space where he can learn to walk without fear of him hitting his head on the hard floors.","purchase_model":"Size: 36 Color: Cream-gray-beige  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-09-20 17:50:15"},{"user":"kmcm","content":"This is exactly what I was looking for! This mat is made of soft foam, less than half an inch thick, and every square tile is 12in x 12in. It has been very easy to clean, I just wet a wash rag with dawn dish soap, water, and a splash of vinegar. I have not had any issues so far.This would make for a perfect mat for a playpen or just extra cushion in the babies room/play space.I ended up using this pack to build a temporary wall in front of our curtains as baby is learning to crawl. I will definitely be ordering the larger pack next so I can make a soft spot to play and have some extras incase I need another barrier around the house lol.Colors are nice, mine is grey, white, and a tan/taupe color! I think this is the perfect price for what you get. I shopped around for awhile and these mats can be extremely expensive. This one is affordable and actually looks pretty nice once it is put together. I do wish they made a solid set in grey, but this one is probably more fun!","purchase_model":"Size: 16 Color: Cream-gray-beige  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-08-25 17:50:15"},{"user":"Kristin","content":"Update: customer service contacted me to explain they recently changed their product size which is why the 16 piece I ordered a few months couldn\u2019t connect with the 36 piece one I just got.They assured me this would not be a problem anymore and refunded my purchase while allowing me to keep the 36 piece so I could purchase a new 16 piece to match it.Nice product.I think it\u2019s too expensive but when I needed more after I bought the 16 piece I purchased the 36 piece (at a cringeworthy price) and they are slightly different sizes despite product description claiming both the 16 piece and the 36 piece are 12x12.They do not line up correctly and can\u2019t connect with each other.Not to mention that even if they could connect it wouldn\u2019t be on the textured side.The pieces align reversely when u try and connect the textured side of the 16 piece to the textured side of the 36 piece.Again doesn\u2019t matter because they are different sizes.Actually glad I have a reason to get my money back.$60 for 36 pieces is too much anyway.","purchase_model":"Size: 36 Color: Blue-brown-beige  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-09-24 17:50:15"},{"user":"Jennie Mireles","content":"I was nervous to buy these because I have 2 dogs and a cat. But these have held up surprisingly well!! The edge pieces are my babies favorite toy though and they love to pull them up ????Easy to clean , easy to fit together, decent thickness and padding, love that you can make different configurations for the space needed. Good value in my experience. Ended up buying 3 sets because I was impressed. My dogs nails haven\u2019t made punctures in it yet compared to the may that came with our playpen.","purchase_model":"Size: 16 Color: Cream-gray-beige  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-08-24 17:50:15"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"Good for the price, thick and has vibrant color.

I ended up with about 7 x 10 ft when combining the 36 and 16. Much more affordable than the \"rug\" style mats that other companies sell for $300-400. My baby doesn't fuss on this mat at all. It seems to be much more comfortable for him to roll on and topple over on than the flimsy fold up mat I had before. Me and my husband also find more comfort sitting and laying on this mat with him. The texture allows for a better grip and more traction so my baby will surely be crawling on this thing in no time. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I'll be buying more for the playroom and bedroom.","purchase_model":"Size: 36 Color: Cream-gray-beige  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-09 17:50:15"},{"user":"I loved this product but when i received the coffee pot was dented up.
